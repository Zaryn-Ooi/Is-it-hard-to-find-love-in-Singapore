## Project Objective :
Despite having more opportunities to meet people, the age at which Singaporeans are getting hitched continues to rise.

As of 2020, the median age of first-time grooms in Singapore was 30.4 years old and 28.8 years old for first-time brides. While this had remained relatively constant for men since 2011, the median age of marriage for women had been increasing, indicating a trend amongst Singaporean women in delaying marriage.

According to an interview done by TODAY, singles aged between 20 and 35 said that they were dating actively and going on dates as frequently as once every two weeks. However, these dates usually fell short of their expectations and did not progress to any long-term relationship.

So, the main question of this project is to determine: Is it hard to find love in Singapore ?

## Project Overview :
In this project, we will explore multiple machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM), and vectorization strategies to identify the one that performs the best.

## Dataset Description :
The dataset consists of 211 data extracted from the comments of a youtube video.

There are 3 columns in this dataset:

Name: the name of the youtube user who commented the video
Comments: the text of the comment
Likes: the number of likes of the comment
